The most part of my project is done on Power Apps, and I have given more details about the project in the description when submitting the project and the video that I have uplaoded. 

This repository only includes the code that was used in Azure machine learning: 
- azuremlcode1: Shows classification model using notebook to determine the onset of diabetes
- azuremlcode2: Shows the use of additional parameters on Singapore's data on diabetes to improve data obtained from the model.
